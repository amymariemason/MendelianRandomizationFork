<!-- badges: end -->

The MendelianRandomization R package provides a comprehensive set of
methods for performing Mendelian randomization analyses with summarized
data. We include methods for both single exposure and multiple exposure
analyses, as well as methods to manage correlated instruments.

Summarized data on genetic associations with the exposure and with the
outcome can be obtained from large consortia using websites such as
[Phenoscanner](http://www.phenoscanner.medschl.cam.ac.uk/) and [GWAS
catalog](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/gwas/). These data can be used for
obtaining causal estimates using Mendelian Randomization. For an
overview of this approach see
[here](https://www.mendelianrandomization.com/index.php/what-is-mr) for
links to explanations and examples.

## Installation

``` r
# Install released version from CRAN
install.packages("Mendelian Randomization")
```

## Usage

If you are just getting started with MendelianRandomization we recommend
starting with the tutorial [vignettes](articles/Data_Input.html),
starting with understanding the data input format.

## Bugs and Feedback

If you encounter any issues, bugs, or have suggestions for improvements
while using our R package, then let us know.

Please report bugs to the package maintainer [Stephen
Burgess](mailto:sb452@medschl.cam.ac.uk)

We are particularly keen to include further MR analysis code for other
two sample MR methods in our package. Please let us know if you have
working R code that is useful to include.  
You can [fork the package from
Github](https://github.com/cran/MendelianRandomization) to test adding
additional function compatibility.

## Example Analysis

This is an example analysis of lipid effects on coronary artery disease
using the example data included with the package.

``` r
library(MendelianRandomization) #load package

MRInputObject <- mr_input(bx = ldlc, 
                          bxse = ldlcse, 
                          by = chdlodds, 
                          byse = chdloddsse)
```

The variables ldlc, hdlc, trig, and chdlodds are the genetic
associations with (respectively) LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol,
triglycerides, and coronary heart disease (CHD) risk for 28 genetic
variants reported by Waterworth et al (2010). The respective standard
errors of the associations are given as ldlcse, hdlcse, trigse, and
chdloddsse.

### Perform Mendelian randomization analysis

We can use this package to perform two-sample Mendelian Randomization
analysis with a wide variety of methods. Here we show the inverse
weighted variance method.

``` r
MRAllObject_ivw <- mr_ivw(MRInputObject) # Perform IVW Mendelian randomization analysis

MRAllObject_ivw  #view results
#> 
#> Inverse-variance weighted method
#> (variants uncorrelated, random-effect model)
#> 
#> Number of Variants : 28 
#> 
#> ------------------------------------------------------------------
#>  Method Estimate Std Error 95% CI       p-value
#>     IVW    2.834     0.530 1.796, 3.873   0.000
#> ------------------------------------------------------------------
#> Residual standard error =  1.920 
#> Heterogeneity test statistic (Cochran's Q) = 99.5304 on 27 degrees of freedom, (p-value = 0.0000). I^2 = 72.9%. 
#> F statistic = 28.0.

mr_plot(MRInputObject, line="ivw", interactive = FALSE) #plot results
```

### Sensitivity Analysis

To assess the robustness of our results, we can perform sensitivity
analyses, such as the Egger regression and the weighted median method:

``` r
MRAllObject <- mr_allmethods(MRInputObject, method="main") # Perform mr-Egger and median Mendelian randomization analysis

MRAllObject  #view results
#>           Method Estimate Std Error 95% CI        P-value
#>    Simple median    1.755     0.740   0.305 3.205   0.018
#>  Weighted median    2.683     0.419   1.862 3.504   0.000
#>              IVW    2.834     0.530   1.796 3.873   0.000
#>         MR-Egger    3.253     0.770   1.743 4.762   0.000
#>      (intercept)   -0.011     0.015  -0.041 0.018   0.451

mr_plot(MRAllObject) #plot results
```

methods.
